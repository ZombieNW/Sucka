## What?

I needed a clean way of extracting individual user's audio from a Discord VC. So I took matters into my own hands.

## How?

1. Install packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Rename `example.env` to `.env` and add your Discord bot token and Guild/Admin id's
3. Run the bot `python main.py`
